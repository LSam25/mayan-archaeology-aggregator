## Background
Mayan archaeology news is scattered across platforms like X, making it hard for enthusiasts to stay updated. This problem is common for niche interests. As an archaeology fan, I want to streamline access to these updates.

## Data Sources and AI Methods
- **Data**: Real-time posts from X.com containing keywords like "Mayan archaeology," "Mayan ruins," or "Mayan discovery," accessed via the Twitter API.
- **AI Techniques**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) to filter relevant posts and rank them by engagement (likes, retweets). Optionally, clustering to group similar headlines.

## How It’s Used
Archaeology enthusiasts visit a local site or GitHub page to see a curated list of trending Mayan archaeology headlines from X. Users include hobbyists, researchers, and educators tracking discoveries.

## Challenges
The project may miss posts not using specific keywords, struggle with API rate limits, or misrank headlines due to spam. It won’t cover news from non-X sources.

## What Next
Expand to other platforms (e.g., Reddit), add a sentiment analysis feature, or create a mobile app. Collaboration with coders and archaeologists could enhance accuracy and reach.

## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by the Elements of AI course and X.com’s real-time data potential.
